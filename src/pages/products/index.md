        We sell green and roasted coffee beans that are sourced directly from
        independent farmers and farm cooperatives. We’re proud to offer a
        variety of coffee beans grown with great care for the environment and
        local communities. Check our post or contact us directly for current
        availability.

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.

faq:
  - question: Are you guys not professional?
    answer: Yes, we are professional. We truly are. We just like to make our work
      enjoyable and want you to get a sense of our personality. Gen Z marketing
      isn’t for everyone, and we know that. We want to work with those willing
      to be different and unique. But let’s find a time to call and we promise
      you’ll experience the utmost respect and professionalism.
  - question: What are Memes?
    answer: Great question. Memes take photos and add some sort of text or message
      to them. Here are a couple of examples of brands that use memes
      effectively (Gordon, show SlimJims, Chipotle, Gushers, Sparknotes,
      etchere).
  - question: Do you offer full-agency services?
    answer: Great question and I have the WORST answer for you. It depends. Imagine
      if Starbucks came and asked to work with them on Social Media management,
      do you think it would be the same for a local coffee shop? Unfortunately
      not. But we are VERY transparent with our pricing. Screw companies that
      take advantage of you. We are open and honest with what we charge.
  - question: Am I locked into a contract if we work together?
    answer: Yes and no. We truly do work by honesty, integrity, and trust. And we
      like our clients to do the same. While we do have contracts, you’ll never
      be fully locked in to it. If special circumstances arise, we will be as
      flexible as possible to keep you happy. But we like our deals to be at
      least 6-months.
